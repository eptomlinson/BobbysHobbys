      "description": "It is easier to do than it looks. Shut off the water, close the line to the toilet, remove the old toilet, and put the new one in, making sure to use the wax O-ring so that it is flat against the floor. You can shunt it if it won't stay flat. Oh, and you should have someone helping you, so you'll need to buy them pizza/beer afterwards."

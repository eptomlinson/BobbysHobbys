You could always get a cheapo bike from Walmart, but if you want something that will last, you probably need to shell out at least 500. Great way to build endurance and leg muscles.

You don't necessarily have to spend any money, you could just lift heavy stuff around the house, but it is admittedly harder to track progress that way."
